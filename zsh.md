# To Set Up Oh-My-Zsh

Had sysadmin install ZShell
`sudo yum install zsh`

Had sysadmin set ZShell as default shell (replacing bash)

Installed "Oh My Zsh" (the "manual way" I think)

Customized my ZSH profile as shown here (just a changed theme and plugins and added a bunch of aliases)

Now I have colors I like and little extras like these:
